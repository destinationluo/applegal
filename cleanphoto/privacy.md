# PhotoCleaner – Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: 2025-08-08

Thank you for choosing PhotoCleaner.  
Protecting your privacy is our top priority.  
This document explains **what data we collect, how we process it, and what choices you have** when you use PhotoCleaner (“the App”).

---

## 1. Who we are
**Developer:** `mogu`  
**Support:** moguiris133@gmail.com

---

## 2. What information we collect

| Category | Details | Stored **on your device** | Sent **off device** |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Photos & videos** | Used only to detect duplicate / similar images via Apple PhotoKit.* | ✔ | ❌ |
| **Purchase receipts** | Apple-signed receipt to verify lifetime unlock. | ✔ | ❌ |
| **Crash logs** (optional) | If you choose “Share With App Developers” in iOS Settings › Privacy › Analytics. | ✔ (Apple servers) | ❌ (we never receive raw logs) |

\* Scanning happens **entirely on-device**. PhotoCleaner never uploads, shares, or stores your photos on external servers.

---

## 3. How we use your data
1. **Duplicate detection** – Algorithms run locally; results are shown only to you.  
2. **Unlock verification** – Receipt is validated via Apple’s StoreKit 2 to confirm your one-time purchase.  
3. **Diagnostics** – Aggregate, anonymous crash stats from Apple help us improve stability (no personal data).

We do **not**:
- Track you across other apps or websites.  
- Share data with advertising networks.  
- Sell or rent any personal information.

---

## 4. Data retention
Because we do not upload or store your photos, **we retain no personal data on our servers**.  
Purchase receipts remain on-device until you delete the App; deleting the App removes all locally stored data.

---

## 5. Your choices & rights
| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Withdraw analytics sharing** | iOS Settings › Privacy & Security › Analytics & Improvements › turn off “Share with App Developers”. |
| **Delete all data** | Delete the App – this removes receipts, cached thumbnails, and settings. |
| **Restore purchase** | Tap “Restore Purchase” in Settings inside the App; no new data is created. |
| **Contact us / request info** | Email **support@yourdomain.com** – we respond within 30 days. |

Residents of the EU/EEA (GDPR) and California (CCPA) have the right to access, correct, or erase personal data; contact us as above.

## 6. Third-party services

| Service | Purpose | Data shared |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Apple StoreKit / App Store** | Payment processing, receipt validation | Purchase receipt (handled by Apple) |
| **Apple Crash Reporting** (opt-in) | Stability diagnostics | Anonymous crash logs |

No other third-party SDKs or analytic frameworks are integrated.

---

## 7. Children’s privacy
PhotoCleaner is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us for deletion.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy for legal or functional reasons. Changes will appear on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continuing to use the App after an update signifies acceptance.
