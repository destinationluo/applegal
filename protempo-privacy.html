    We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Sensor Data (Apple Watch & iPhone)</strong><br>
    The App uses motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) on your device to analyze your golf swing rhythm. This data is processed in real-time <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not transmit this raw sensor data to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
